2046's loop widget boosts you website prototyping.

== Description ==

http://youtu.be/dU8Qll6Wqes

The Drag&Drop content management is here. 
When you build the content with "2046's loop widget", the only thing you have to decide is what content you want to see and where. All the programming you always wanted to avoid is gone.
The widget covers the most routinely used content logic. The aim of this widget is to speed up the process of content structuring and simplicity of usage while keeping the standarts.

The widget went through Localization process and so the core changed a bit. You might have to resave the widgets.
If you encounter any problem, please let me know on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/2046s-widget-loops">forum</a>.


= Post types =

The widget automatically finds all the public post types your WP has. Native Post and Pages and also your custom post types.
It will load it's taxonomies. Native (category, tags), custom taxonimies, settings for comments form and more. For the page types it gives you an extra hierarchy settings. 

Since the version 0.246 the widget has a third main function and that is a "gallery builder". The Gallery builder lets you get images from the currently seen post/page, or definied post/page by id.
It has many settings, like image linking, show/hide post title, settings for image/title location and so on.

= The content =

All the content settings lays on the left side of the widget. There you can select if you would like to see the post title, featured post image. You can choose if 
you would like to see full content, excerpt or without the body content and simply show or hide post meta such as comment numbers, date, author, taxonomies etc.
In the case of the I call it "final post/page" the comment form settings lets you show or hide the comment form with comments.
The navigation cover most of the native Wordpress next, prev links, plus if you have Scribu's Page Navi plugin installed then you can choose even that kind of nice navigation. 

= The logic =

The logic is on the right side of the widget.

All the post types in Wordpress are basically linear with no hierarchy, they are categorized and can be tagged. If you are skilled enough or help your self with a plugin you can
create custom post types and add some extra taxonomies. You can find them all listed in the widget and select the logic on which the widget will render the content
to the front end of your site. Like, when you want to see "x" posts from the category pets, or "x" posts from the same category as the actual main post is, or select
posts exactly by their ID or by their custom meta. It lets you order the result by many available parameters.
On the contrary you can also restrict the widget content not to be shown certain template types, such as index, category, post, or page, search result, or hide it on certain page by it's ID. 

The Wordpress page types are hierarchical. The widget shows you all the settings as like for the posts (even taxonomies if you made any), plus particular hierarchical
logic based on which the widget will show the content.

The final content loop has no settings in this logic area. It doesn't need any, it simply shows the final content. By the final content is meant the main post/page/custom post types
 content on the (template speaking) single.php, page.php.


<em>All widgets allows you to display the picture belonging to the looped post/page/custom post type. For that matter the Wordpress "Featured picture" is used.<br />
The "Debug" mode renders the Query arguments you build by the widget to the front-end of your site, right before the loop.</em>

== Installation ==

If you are installing 2046's loop widgets for the first time, follow these steps:

1. Upload the `2046s-widget-loops` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` abs activate it in the admin plugin area.
2. Else, download and activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' in the WordPress adimin area.

Widget has no extra settings. All the settings are done in the widget area as like for any other normal widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= How can I use it`? =

First you have to have some dynamic sidebars defined.
Some themes have them registered already, but I doubt they have them in the main content area where this loop widget meets it's intention.
(Most of the templates have them only in so called sidebars, or header. Widgets are commonly are used for category listing, tag cloud, Facebook features etc.)
<em>The dynamic sidebar is a "slot" where you can put <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets">widgets</a> with countless features.</em> 

Log in to your admin and go to Appearance>Widgets. If you don't see the Widgets item, then your template hes no sidebars defined.
How to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_sidebar">register sidebar</a>.

= What do you suggest? =

What I do is, that I register sidebars at least one per logical block in the webdesign layout (template).
Then using 2046's loop widget you can place the content loops anywhere you like and how many you like.
You can interlace them by any other widgets. By drag & dropping the widgets into the dynamic sidebar areas you can easily define the structure of the whole website.

= What about design? =

If your template has the most basic CSS setups then you don't have to wary. Widgets will nicely follow the actual template CSS rules and will obediently follow the predefined
design. If you still needs some exceptions for this or that widget or it's element, every widget has it's own CSS "id" or "class" so you can easily bend them to your needs.

= I do not see what I have expected to see. =

Well the widget is fairly complex.
Check if the restrictions are not beating each other and also check if the content you expect there really is sortable the way you like it to be.
If none of these checks works, then let me know on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/2046s-widget-loops">forum</a>, I'll do my best.

= Known bugs =

 * When you are in the widget setting in the part [elswhere]>[selected taxonomy] then the taxonomy fields are sometimes multiplied. This happens when always you drag&drop the widget.
Don't wary this is just a Javascript skin effect. If you save the widget, or you come back next time, it will be fine. (I'm working on it).

== Upgrade Notice == 

= 0.247 =

 * resave widgets (as always)

= 0.244 =

 * resave the widgets, the core changed again (sory for that)

= 0.242 =

 * The scafolding changed a bit. If you haven't use it (I mean custom class), nothing is changing for you. If you do. You have to rethink the design a bit. The reson why I changed it is that the native widget div broke the Bootsrap logic. I'm sorry for that. 

= 0.241 =
 * as of the new options for image linking, the internal values changed. If your image setup stop to work (I bet it will), just reset image settings.

= 0.2 = [22.02.2012]

Warning. The version 0.2 is totally rewritten. Though it is build on the same concept like the previous public version 0.131 all the widgets shirnked to only one widget.
When you update you have to build your widget logic from the scratch, but this time easier with lot more functionality.
The 0.2 version can be considered as a different plugin then the previous 0.131 version was.

= 0.131 =

 * some fixes

= 0.13 = 

If you have any problems, just re-save widgets. Note the recent widget is replaced by the Final loop widget.

When you have multiple widgets where you filter the content by the taxonomies, than when you save some of these widgets the taxonomy selector is multiplied for other widget than the one you just saved ;(

= Thanks =

Thanks to Scribu for his WP Navi that I have "integrated" as one of the navigation settings in to the widget. And thanks to Sribu again. When I tried to find an answer for 
all the uncommon problems it was his answer somewhere in the Interweb that helps me to find the solution. Thanks to you allyou are my source of knowledge.
