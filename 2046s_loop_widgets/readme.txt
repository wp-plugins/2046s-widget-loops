Couple widgets in the form of plugin that lets you build your own website without touching a code.

== Description ==

2046's loop widgets boost you website prototyping.

Unlike other loop widgets "2046's loop widgets" are made with top-down logic.
Meaning, when you build the content you don't think about the programming logic behind it. The only thing you have to decide is what content you want to see and where.

These widgets covers the most routinely used Post and Page content logic. They are not supposed to fully cover all the possible layouts.
The aim of these widgets is to speed up the process of content structuring and simplicity of usage rather then offer overwhelming complex solution where you loose your self in an instant.

`0.1: 2012-02-05`: Initial version

= Known bugs =
When the widget is droped into the widget area it won't get its ID and so the jQuery switch for Logic part won't hide unnecessary inputs.
Once the widget is saved everything works as it supposed to.
This is not a cruicial bug, it wont brake anything it is just something I want to fix. If you know how to get the wodget ID before it is saved, let me know.

= Future plans =

* Fix the Jquery initial widget ID problem
* Add Post types select box (on the way...the WP jQuery ui causes problems still. )
* Add selection box for post, pages, instead if manual ID insertition
